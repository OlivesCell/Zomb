I noticed that changing the camera settings on the phone help for the pictures but the videos are still in the wrong aspect ratio

if you do it this way you don't need to faceU app and you don't need so many other beauty apps because the problem is Android doesn't allow you to correct the hardwares aspect ratio for the camera

I'm trying to find something that can help me do this

So basically the camera adds 10 lbs because Google made it so https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27057428/correct-aspect-ratio-in-android

And the apps that might have worked are not even there anymore https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/98427/change-aspect-ratio-of-pictures/98683#98683

So using the browser is better...

This https://ui.resizing.app/ helps with pics and this https://www.onlineconverter.com/resize-video.html with videos also.

Control video streaming aspect with an adjusted fork of : .
