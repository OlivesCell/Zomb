The app: https://streame-u.herokuapp.com/ .
and you share a link that is generated when visiting the app with others in Telegram that you want to conference call through Telegram's chromium browser.
For example, share  https://streame-u.herokuapp.com/1b24b1c2-02a8-49e9-83b4-02d1799caf75 with someone then you both must open it to see each other.
Just remember to zoom out as it is adjusted for HD.

I noticed that changing the camera settings on the phone help for the pictures but the videos are still in the wrong aspect ratio

if you do it this way you don't need to faceU app and you don't need so many other beauty apps because the problem is Android doesn't allow you to correct the hardwares aspect ratio for the camera

So basically the camera adds 10 lbs because Google made it so https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27057428/correct-aspect-ratio-in-android
(1-4/5)=20% and (1-3/4)=25% so taking 3:4 aspect to 1:1 is still 5% too small a height however the chip was designed to be conformal and https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3114581/images-aspect-ratio/3114598#3114598 maintaining a image that lies about your faceshape yet makes it impossible to see from the camera's own view and fixing this is a little bit of mathematical challenge but for now at least this will help.

And the apps that might have worked are not even there anymore https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/98427/change-aspect-ratio-of-pictures/98683#98683. Although https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paintastic is one for pictures.

So using the browser is better...

This https://ui.resizing.app/ helps with pics and this https://www.onlineconverter.com/resize-video.html with videos also.

Control video streaming aspect with an adjusted fork of https://github.com/kirankumargonti/zoom-clone.git
